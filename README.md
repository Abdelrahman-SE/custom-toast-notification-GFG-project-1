# Custom Toast Notification System

A fully custom toast notification component built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS Animations**.

This project focuses on **clean architecture**, **DOM manipulation**, and **scalable UI logic** without using any external libraries.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:

- Build reusable UI components from scratch
- Control UI behavior using `data-*` attributes
- Write maintainable, production-ready frontend code

## Key Features

- Four toast types: Success, Error, Info, Warning
- Smooth enter and exit animations
- Animated progress bar with configurable duration

## Technical Highlights

## 1. Data-Driven UI

- All toast behavior is controlled using `data-type` attributes, allowing easy extension without changing core logic.

## 2. Animation Control & Reset

- CSS animations are reliably restarted using a forced reflow technique: - void toast.offsetWidth;
  This ensures animations run correctly on repeated interactions — a common pitfall in frontend development.

## 3. Clean Architecture

- JavaScript handles logic, events, and state
- No inline styling for visual states

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Keyframes & Animations)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- DOM APIs
- Data Attributes

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Strong understanding of DOM manipulation
- Practical use of CSS animations in real UI scenarios
- Ability to write scalable, maintainable frontend code
- Attention to UX details and edge cases
- Comfort working without frameworks when needed
